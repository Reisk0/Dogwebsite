Puppies are hard-wired to appeal to us, with their adorable squishy faces, little 
paws, and wet noses. But there is more to young dogs than downy fur and floppy ears. 
Here are 12 scientific facts about them to coo over:

      <h1>THEY LIKE BABY TALK.</h1>
      <pre>

A January 2017 study found that puppies respond when humans speak in sing-song tones,
but adult dogs couldn’t care less. Researchers from the University of Lyon at 
Saint-Etienne found that people speak more slowly and at a much higher pitch when 
talking to puppies (or pictures of them, at least) than when talking to humans
or adult dogs.

      <h1 > THEY CAN HELP YOU FOCUS.</h1>
      <pre> 
Looking at cute pictures of puppies at work is more productive than you’d think. 
In a 2012 study, Japanese researchers found that viewing pictures of puppies made 
people better at tasks that required close attention. 
Viewing pictures of older dogs, however, was not as effective.
People were more effective and more careful in accomplishing the tasks before them 
if they were flooded by the positive emotions of seeing an amazingly adorable baby 
animal. 
The researchers suggest that maybe people should look at cute things before driving 
or at work to help them focus.

        <h1>THEY REALLY DO LIKE YOU.</h1>
        <pre> 
an a Hungarian study published in 2005, researchers found that pet puppies show 
specific attachments to the humans that care for them. While even wolves that 
had been hand-raisedfrom birth by humans didn’t show any preference for the people 
that raised them—they reacted the same way to strangers as to the caregivers they 
had spent their entirelives with—domestic puppies as young as 4 months old showed 
a significant preferenceto their owners. They followed and greeted their owners 
more than they did strangehumans, and when their owner left, they tended to stand
by the door waiting for them to return.

      <header><h1>THEIR SENSES DON'T DEVELOP UNTIL A FEW WEEKS AFTER BIRTH.</h1>
        <pre> 
When they’re first born, puppies only respond to warmth, touch, and smell.
Their eyes remain closed, and they can’t hear. Puppies don’t fully develop the 
ability to hear until they are 4 weeks old, and it is not until 6 weeks of age, 
on average, that they develop full vision. Once their senses develop, they begin
exploring the world in earnest, beginning a critical period of socialization.

      <h1>IT'S IMPORTANT TO FAMILIARIZE THEM WITH PEOPLE EARLY.</h1>
      <pre>

Studies have shown that puppies are most socially malleable during their second
month of life. During that time, their sensory systems are developed enoughto 
let them explore, but they’re not yet fearful of new experiences. As one 1961 study
on puppy litters isolated from humans found, puppies that aren’t played with
showed "increasing tendency to withdraw from human beings after 5 weeks of age
and unless socialization occurred before 14 weeks of age, withdrawal reactions
from humans became so intense that normal relationships could not thereafter
be established."
